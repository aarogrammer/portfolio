                                This project is for a start up that myself, and friends who have a passion for the creative industry started up over the summer.<br />
                                With three of our team members finishing their final year at University, The Bear & The Meerkat is currently a freelance collaboration.<br />

                            <h3>Development</h3>
                            <p>
                                For this project I decided to go a bit more adventurous and use an exciting technology - AngularJS, and some Angular modules such as ui-router, to set up routing and ngAnimate to animate views (pages) to dynamically come in, rather than having to wait for the page to load.
                                <br />
                                I have used AngularJS before when developing applications when using the MEAN stack, but that was simply for creating RESTful APIâ€™s and some data binding. The use of AngularJS this time around was all about user experience.
                                <br />
                                When a user clicks on a link to load a new page, I slide the page into their view, rather than having them wait around for a page to load. All pages are pretty small in file size so they load almost instantly, giving a fun, book-like website to look through.
                                <br />
                                The design was created using Bootstrap, a front-end framework for creating fully responsive web applications. This allows for a quicker turn around as I can use Bootstrap elements, such as the container and columns, to have everything grouped together so that they respond well together. Of course a lot of CSS on my end had to be done, Bootstrap made it much easier to develop.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                            <p>
                                A fun, yet challenging project having a chance to work with amazing technologies like AngularJS, and being able to work concurrently with designers to build graphics and a brand.
