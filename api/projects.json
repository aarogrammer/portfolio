        "description" : "<p>Cyonik is a collaboration website built by myself and my good friend <a href='https://github.com/zaffri' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Steven</a>. </p> <p> This specific website is a Single Page Application (SPA) blog built with WordPress. Our aim for this blog is to help others with understanding software,programming and other web related activities. </p> <p> We will also use this platform to show our software (both commercial and open source), along with the development process of these projects.<br /> With many years experience with WordPress, I decided that I wanted to create a SPA using this CMS. WordPress provides a great REST API, which makes it simple to communicate with the backend and display data accordingly with blistering speed due to the data just being JSON. VueJS played a massive role in allowing this web application to be efficient and well organised. State Management using VueX helped with mutating states and changing data smoothly. </p> <p> I could talk about how fun this project was for hours! </p>",
        "conclusion" : "<p>I develop WordPress websites for clients everyday but have never used WordPress REST API to create a web application. This was both fun and very challenging. Working with a not so well documented API (at the time), figuring out the best way to query data with little loading time and remembering states, it was definitely an experience!</p>",

          "description" : "<p>Allanwater Homes wanted a revamp of their website, which was previously developed by The Buzz Agency but designed by another agency. This gave The Buzz Agency more control on how the website will look/work as we could fully design and develop the website. </p> <p> Once the design team designed a mock-up and it was approved by the client, I started developing the new website. The website is built for WordPress and heavily uses an awesome plugin called Advanced Custom Fields to extend the functionality of WordPress. This allowed for me to add options for each page to easily allow the client to edit the website if they wanted to. </p> <p> On top of normal development, I done a lot of extra work making sure the websites performance was fast and efficient on server load (and for client’s data/connection). I was able to have the website loading pages under 1 second (for most of the time!) and decent caching set up so there was less strain on the server. </p>",
          "conclusion" : "<p>Although this project had a really tight timescale, I feel that the design team done an awesome job designing this website and that we pulled off a beautiful website.</p>",

Their previous website wasn’t showcasing their amazing products and wasn’t reflecting well on their brand. </p> <p> Gideon Robinson hired The Buzz Agency to design and develop their new website. The website was built for WordPress for ease of management. With it being a new website, this gave me a lot of flexibility on how I would build this website. I decided to approach the codebase in an Object Oriented (OO) architecture so that it was easier to maintain and so that certain methods can easily be reused. I had never developed a WordPress website using OO PHP, which was challenging and pretty enjoyable. </p>",
        "conclusion" : "<p>The design team at The Buzz Agency yet again knocked it out the park with a beautiful design. This made my job as a developer much easier with specific guidelines to follow to create a beautiful application. This was a great project and was fun meeting up with Gideon to understand how he wanted his brand to be presented online.</p>",

        "description" : "<p>For this project I decided to go a bit more adventurous and use an exciting technology - AngularJS, and some Angular modules such as ui-router, to set up routing and ngAnimate to animate views (pages) to dynamically come in, rather than having to wait for the page to load. </p> <p> I have used AngularJS before when developing applications when using the MEAN stack, but that was simply for creating RESTful API’s and some data binding. The use of AngularJS this time around was all about user experience. When a user clicks on a link to load a new page, I slide the page into their view, rather than having them wait around for a page to load. All pages are pretty small in file size so they load almost instantly, giving a fun, book-like website to look through. </p> <p> The design was created using Bootstrap, a front-end framework for creating fully responsive web applications. This allows for a quicker turn around as I can use Bootstrap elements, such as the container and columns, to have everything grouped together so that they respond well together. Of course a lot of CSS on my end had to be done, Bootstrap made it much easier to develop. </p>",
        "conclusion" : "<p>A fun, yet challenging project having a chance to work with amazing technologies like AngularJS, and being able to work concurrently with designers to build graphics and a brand.",

        "description" : "<p>Callum approached me with the goal of having a fresh, clean website to compete in the Marine industry. It was obvious after a little bit of research that none of his competitors had much of a web presence and that their websites were very outdated. This gives 360Marine a chance to stand out. </p> <p> Callum and I met a few times to discuss how he wants his company to be presented online, how we can define his brand to make a large impact, and overall how to get potential business from his website. </p> <p> The solution was to create a fun, friendly website that was easy to look at and didn’t feel like a task to find out information. With it being an information based website, we found it would make most sense to have a one page website, that is broken in sections, and allows for the potential client to get in contact. </p>",
        "conclusion" : "<p>It was great hearing Callum's story on why he started 360Marine and to help a business with a bright-future take its first steps online.<br> The design of the website was fun to create, having photography done to add more character to the design.</p>",

Meeting at her salon was a great way to understand what Elcee's is, and have a general feel of the salon. </p> <p> I designed the website to look similar to the design of the salon, using similar fonts and colours to achieve the final product. </p>",
