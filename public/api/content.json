I work mostly on building microservices and deploying them to Kubernetes. The communication between microservices also depends on the requirements, but I am regularly using message brokers, REST APIs and GraphQL to bring everything together.</p> <p>With the use of Docker, most of the services I develop, regardless of the language, are deployed to Kubernetes. I typically create the K8s clusters, configure load balancers, ingress controllers and certificate management (TLS, auth rotation etc.).</p> <p>I have experience with automating pipelines (CI/CD), ensuring code quality and reliable deployments.
