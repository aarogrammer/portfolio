                           <h3>Development</h3>
                             <p>
                               Callum approached me with the goal of having a fresh, clean website to compete in the Marine industry. It was obvious after a little bit of research that none of his competitors had much of a web presence and that their websites were very outdated. This gives 360Marine a chance to stand out.
                               <br />
                               Callum and I met a few times to discuss how he wants his company to be presented online, how we can define his brand to make a large impact, and overall how to get potential business from his website.
                               <br />
                               The solution was to create a fun, friendly website that was easy to look at and didnâ€™t feel like a task to find out information. With it being an information based website, we found it would make most sense to have a one page website, that is broken in sections, and allows for the potential client to get in contact.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                            <p>
                              It was great hearing Callum's story on why he started 360Marine and to help a business with a bright-future take its first steps online.<br />
                              The design of the website was fun to create, having photography done to add more character to the design.
