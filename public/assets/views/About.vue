                        <p>
                            My name is Aaron, I am a Software Developer from Glasgow, Scotland who loves to develop websites.<br />
                            I recently graduated with a First Class degree in BSc Hons Web and Mobile Development.<br />
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I have been developing websites for around 5 years in many languages; my favourites being JavaScript & PHP.<br />
                            I also really like some frameworks and environments such as NodeJS, VueJS, AngularJS and Laravel. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I have a huge passion for Open Source Software. I enjoy writting software that others may find useful and love helping others learn how to program. <br />
                            I write a lot of software in my free time and try to upload them to my GitHub. I have a backlog of software I am uploading so make sure to <a href="https://github.com/aarogrammer/">follow me on Github</a> to stay updated!
                        </p>

                            In my free time I like to play &amp; watch rugby, cycle, listen &amp; play music and travel.
